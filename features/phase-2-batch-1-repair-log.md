REPAIR_LOG
Artifact: features/phase-2-batch-1.md
Detected_Issues: [
  {"id": "CLJ-R-01", "type": "API/Schema Conflict", "severity": "Medium", "evidence": "CLJ-001 API spec for journal legs allows both debit and credit, while the DDL correctly enforces mutual exclusivity. The API contract is weaker than the implementation."},
  {"id": "CLJ-R-02", "type": "Missing Detail", "severity": "Medium", "evidence": "CLJ-002 describes posting to a general_ledger table with a single 'amount' column, but doesn't explicitly state the transformation logic from the two-column debit/credit format in journal_legs. This is a critical implementation detail."},
  {"id": "CLJ-R-03", "type": "Missing Detail", "severity": "High", "evidence": "CLJ-002 mentions 'atomic updates' as an NFR but does not specify the required mechanism (e.g., database transaction) in the spec, risking inconsistent state if one part of the operation fails."},
  {"id": "CLJ-R-04", "type": "Compliance Gap", "severity": "Low", "evidence": "The features are fundamentally compliant with double-entry accounting, but do not explicitly mention IFRS/GAAP alignment, which is a core project requirement."}
]
Predicted_Failures: [
  {"scenario": "An API client is built based on the CLJ-001 spec and sends a payload with both a debit and a credit in the same leg, causing unexpected validation errors.", "probability": "High", "impact": "Medium", "trigger": "Third-party integration development."},
  {"scenario": "A junior developer implements the CLJ-002 posting logic and incorrectly sums debits and credits into the 'amount' field without negating credits, leading to corrupted ledger balances.", "probability": "Medium", "impact": "Critical", "trigger": "Feature implementation."},
  {"scenario": "During a service outage, a journal is marked as 'Posted' but the ledger balance update fails, leading to a reconciliation nightmare that requires manual intervention.", "probability": "Low", "impact": "Critical", "trigger": "Partial system failure during a post operation."}
]
Fixes_Applied: [
  {"scope": "CLJ-001 API Spec", "change_summary": "Updated the OpenAPI snippet for journal legs to use 'oneOf' constraint, making it explicit that either 'debit' or 'credit' is required, but not both."},
  {"scope": "CLJ-001 Business Value", "change_summary": "Added explicit mention of 'according to IFRS/GAAP principles' to the User Story and Business Value to tie the feature directly to compliance goals."},
  {"scope": "CLJ-002 DB Schema", "change_summary": "Added a comment to the DDL snippet specifying the transformation logic: 'If debit is present, amount is positive. If credit is present, amount is negative.'"},
  {"scope": "CLJ-002 NFRs", "change_summary": "Elevated the 'atomic updates' NFR with a bolded note specifying the need for a database transaction to ensure atomicity across table updates."},
  {"scope": "CLJ-002 Rollout Plan", "change_summary": "Added a forward-looking note to monitor for demand for a bulk-posting API endpoint to address potential performance bottlenecks from high-volume sequential posts."}
]
Validation_Proof: {
  "tests_passed": "API specs are now consistent with DB constraints. Critical business logic (debit/credit transform) is explicitly documented. Atomicity requirement is clarified.",
  "sims_passed": "Simulated developer hand-off; ambiguity around transformation and atomicity is removed. Simulated API consumer review; debit/credit exclusivity is clear.",
  "metrics_deltas": "N/A",
  "residual_risk": "Low. The specifications are now more robust and less open to misinterpretation."
