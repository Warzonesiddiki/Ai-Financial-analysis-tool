### **Phase 2: Feature Universe â€” Batch 2 (Accounts Payable & Banking/Reconciliation)**

---

#### **A) Feature Item: Ingest Vendor Bill via API/Email/OCR**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `AP-001` / Ingest Vendor Bill via API/Email/OCR / Accounts Payable / AI-agent
*   **User Story**: As a `Finance Clerk`, I need the system to automatically ingest and digitize vendor bills received via email attachment, direct API submission, or scanned upload, so that I can eliminate manual data entry.
*   **Business Value**: Drastically reduces manual labor and errors in the AP process. Accelerates the entire procure-to-pay cycle. KPI: >95% of incoming bills processed automatically with >99% field-level accuracy.
*   **Dependencies**: `MDM-002` (Vendor Master Data), `CLJ-001` (Create Journal Entry).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given a unique email address like "bills@<tenant-id>.finos.ai" exists
    When a vendor sends an email with a PDF bill attached
    Then the system parses the PDF attachment using an OCR AI Agent
    And creates a "Draft" bill in the system with vendor name, invoice number, amount, and line items correctly extracted.

    Given a vendor is registered with an API key
    When they POST a structured JSON bill to the /v1/bills/ingress endpoint
    Then a "Draft" bill is created instantly with 100% accuracy.
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**:
    *   Handles password-protected and poorly scanned PDFs gracefully by flagging for manual review.
    *   SLA for email ingestion: <2 minutes from receipt to draft bill creation.
    *   Accuracy SLO: 99.5% for key fields (vendor, invoice #, total amount, due date).
    *   Security: AI Agent operates in a sandboxed environment.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**:
    ```yaml
    post:
      path: /v1/bills/ingress
      summary: Ingest a structured vendor bill
      security: [{ vendorApiAuth: [] }]
      requestBody:
        content: { application/json: { schema: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/Bill' } } }
      responses:
        '202': { description: 'Bill accepted for processing' }
    ```
*   **DB Schema (DDL snippet)**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE bills (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      vendor_id UUID REFERENCES vendors(id),
      invoice_number TEXT NOT NULL,
      total_amount NUMERIC(38, 18) NOT NULL,
      due_date DATE,
      status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DRAFT',
      ingestion_source VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'API', 'EMAIL', 'UI_UPLOAD'
      raw_file_ref TEXT -- Reference to original file in secure storage
    );
    ```
*   **Migration Plan**: N/A.
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: PII in bills (e.g., bank details) is encrypted at rest with tenant-specific keys. Email processing agent has read-only access and automatically deletes emails after successful ingestion.
*   **Threat Model Snippet**:
    *   **Info Disclosure**: Encrypted storage of raw bills.
    *   **Tampering**: Validation against known vendor data to detect fraudulent bills.
*   **Test Plan**: Test suite with 100+ real-world (anonymized) bill formats. Tests for different languages and currencies.
*   **Telemetry**: Metrics: `bills_ingested_total` (by source), `ocr_accuracy_rate`, `ingestion_latency_seconds`.
*   **Rollout Plan**: Beta release to select customers with high AP volume.
*   **Documentation**: Guide for vendors on using the API ingress. KB article for finance clerks on the email ingestion process.

#### **A) Feature Item: AI-Powered Duplicate Bill Detection**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `AP-002` / AI-Powered Duplicate Bill Detection / Accounts Payable / AI-agent
*   **User Story**: As a `Finance Manager`, I need the system to automatically flag potential duplicate bills during ingestion so that we prevent erroneous double payments.
*   **Business Value**: Prevents financial loss and saves time on manual reconciliation. KPI: >99.9% of duplicate bills detected and flagged.
*   **Dependencies**: `AP-001` (Ingest Bill).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given a bill from "Vendor A" with invoice number "INV-123" for $500 already exists
    When a new bill is ingested from "Vendor A" with invoice number "INV-123" for $500
    Then the new bill is marked with status "Duplicate" and linked to the original.

    Given a bill from "Vendor B" for $1000 dated July 1st exists
    When a new bill is ingested from "Vendor B" for $1000.01 dated July 2nd with no invoice number
    Then the new bill is flagged for "Potential Duplicate Review" based on a fuzzy match of vendor, amount, and date.
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**:
    *   Detects duplicates across different ingestion sources (e.g., email vs. API).
    *   The fuzzy matching algorithm parameters (e.g., amount tolerance, date window) must be configurable per tenant.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**: N/A (internal agent).
*   **DB Schema (DDL snippet)**:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE bills ADD COLUMN duplicate_of_bill_id UUID REFERENCES bills(id);
    ALTER TABLE bills ADD COLUMN review_reason TEXT; -- e.g., 'POTENTIAL_DUPLICATE'
    ```
*   **Migration Plan**: Backfill job to run duplicate detection on historical bills.
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: N/A.
*   **Threat Model Snippet**:
    *   **Tampering**: An attacker might slightly alter an invoice to bypass simple duplicate checks. The AI model must be robust against minor changes.
*   **Test Plan**: Scenarios with exact duplicates, duplicates with minor variations (e.g., +/- 0.01 amount, +/- 2 days), and invoices with similar but legitimately different details.
*   **Telemetry**: Metrics: `duplicate_bills_detected_total`, `potential_duplicates_flagged_total`.
*   **Rollout Plan**: Enabled by default for all tenants.
*   **Documentation**: Explainer on how the duplicate detection logic works and how to resolve flagged bills.

#### **A) Feature Item: Multi-Step Bill Approval Workflows**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `AP-003` / Multi-Step Bill Approval Workflows / Accounts Payable / Workflow
*   **User Story**: As a `Finance Controller`, I need to configure dynamic, multi-step approval workflows for bills based on their amount or department, so that proper spending authority is enforced.
*   **Business Value**: Enforces internal financial controls, improves governance, and provides a clear audit trail for spending approvals.
*   **Dependencies**: `MDM-002` (Vendors), `MDM-005` (Departments).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given a workflow is configured that:
      - Bills < $1000 require manager approval
      - Bills >= $1000 require manager AND department head approval
    When a bill for $500 is submitted
    Then it is routed to the submitter's manager for approval.
    And the bill cannot be paid until approved.
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**: Handles out-of-office delegation. Re-routing if an approver is deactivated.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**:
    ```yaml
    post:
      path: /v1/bills/{bill_id}/approve
      summary: Approve or reject a bill
      requestBody: { content: { application/json: { schema: { properties: { decision: { type: string, enum: ['APPROVED', 'REJECTED'] }, notes: { type: string } } } } } }
    ```
*   **DB Schema (DDL snippet)**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE approval_workflows ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rules JSONB );
    CREATE TABLE approval_steps ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY, bill_id UUID, approver_id UUID, status TEXT );
    ```
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: Approval actions are logged immutably. Users can only approve bills they are assigned to.
*   **Test Plan**: Test various workflow configurations (multi-tier, parallel). Test logic for delegation and re-routing.
*   **Telemetry**: Metrics: `approval_time_avg_seconds`, `rejection_rate`.
*   **Rollout Plan**: Release with a set of default, best-practice workflow templates.
*   **Documentation**: User guide on building and managing approval workflows.

#### **A) Feature Item: Schedule & Execute Bill Payments**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `AP-004` / Schedule & Execute Bill Payments / Accounts Payable / API
*   **User Story**: As an `AP Clerk`, I need to schedule approved bills to be paid on a specific date via our integrated payment provider, so that we can optimize cash flow and pay vendors on time.
*   **Business Value**: Improves treasury management by controlling payment timing. Reduces manual effort of paying bills.
*   **Dependencies**: `AP-003` (Approval Workflows), `Payments-001` (Payment Provider Integration).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given an "Approved" bill for $500 is due on July 31st
    When the user schedules it for payment on July 30th
    Then a payment instruction is created with status "Scheduled"
    And on July 30th, the system executes the payment via the payment provider API.
    And upon successful payment, the bill status becomes "Paid".
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**: Handles payment failures and retries with exponential backoff.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**:
    ```yaml
    post:
      path: /v1/payments/schedule
      summary: Schedule a batch of bills for payment
      requestBody: { content: { application/json: { schema: { properties: { payments: { type: array, items: { properties: { bill_id: UUID, payment_date: date } } } } } } } }
    ```
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: Payment execution requires a separate, highly privileged `payments:execute` permission. MFA may be required for batches over a certain threshold.
*   **Test Plan**: End-to-end tests with payment provider sandbox. Test failure scenarios (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid vendor bank details).
*   **Telemetry**: Events: `PaymentScheduled`, `PaymentExecuted`, `PaymentFailed`.
*   **Documentation**: Guide on scheduling payments and managing payment batches.

#### **A) Feature Item: Securely Connect Bank Accounts (Open Banking)**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `BR-001` / Securely Connect Bank Accounts (Open Banking) / Banking & Reconciliation / UI
*   **User Story**: As a `Business Owner`, I need to securely connect my company's bank accounts to the system using an Open Banking provider (e.g., Plaid, Stripe Financial Connections) so that my transaction data flows in automatically.
*   **Business Value**: Eliminates the need for manual bank statement uploads, providing real-time data for reconciliation and cash flow analysis.
*   **Dependencies**: `Identity-001` (User Authentication).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given I am an authenticated user
    When I click "Connect Bank Account" and complete the Open Banking provider's modal flow
    Then a secure, tokenized connection to my bank is established
    And my bank accounts appear in the system, ready for data synchronization.
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**: Handles token expiry and re-authentication flows.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**: N/A (UI-driven flow with third-party provider).
*   **DB Schema (DDL snippet)**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE bank_connections (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      tenant_id UUID,
      provider VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'PLAID', 'STRIPE'
      access_token_encrypted TEXT NOT NULL, -- Never store raw credentials
      data_residency_region VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
    );
    ```
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: The system **never** stores bank credentials. It only stores revocable, encrypted access tokens. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using region-specific keys to comply with data residency laws.
*   **Test Plan**: Test connection flow with sandbox environments of all supported Open Banking providers.
*   **Telemetry**: Metrics: `bank_connections_successful_total`, `bank_connections_failed_total`.
*   **Documentation**: KB article explaining the security of the bank connection feature.

#### **A) Feature Item: AI Agent for Transaction Categorization**

*   **ID / Title / Domain / Type**: `BR-002` / AI Agent for Transaction Categorization / Banking & Reconciliation / AI-agent
*   **User Story**: As a `Bookkeeper`, I need the system to automatically suggest the correct expense or income category for new bank transactions so that I can reconcile my books faster.
*   **Business Value**: Automates a significant portion of the bookkeeping process, increasing speed and accuracy.
*   **Dependencies**: `BR-001` (Bank Connection), `MDM-001` (Chart of Accounts).
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)**:
    ```gherkin
    Given a new bank transaction "UBER TRIP" for $25 appears
    And historical data shows "UBER" transactions are categorized as "Travel Expenses" (7090)
    Then the system suggests "Travel Expenses" (7090) for the new transaction with a >95% confidence score.

    Given a new transaction "AWS WEB SERVICES" appears with a confidence score below 95%
    Then the transaction is flagged for manual review instead of being auto-categorized.
    ```
*   **Edge Cases & NFRs**: Model learns and improves from user corrections. Handles multi-currency transactions.
*   **API Spec (OpenAPI snippet)**: N/A (internal agent).
*   **Security/Privacy Notes**: The model is trained per-tenant to prevent data leakage between customers.
*   **Test Plan**: Test with a golden dataset of 1M+ categorized transactions. Measure precision and recall.
*   **Telemetry**: Metrics: `transactions_auto_categorized_total`, `categorization_confidence_score_avg`.
*   **Rollout Plan**: Enable with "suggestion mode" first, then offer an "auto-pilot" mode once user trusts the agent.
*   **Documentation**: Guide on how the AI categorization works and how to "teach" it by correcting suggestions.
