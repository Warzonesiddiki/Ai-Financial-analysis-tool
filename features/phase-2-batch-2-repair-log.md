Artifact: features/phase-2-batch-2.md
Detected_Issues: [
  {"id": "APBR-R-01", "type": "Missing Detail", "severity": "Medium", "evidence": "AP-001 (Bill Ingestion) specifies an accuracy SLO but not a latency SLA for processing, which is a critical performance NFR."},
  {"id": "APBR-R-02", "type": "Compliance Gap", "severity": "High", "evidence": "BR-001 (Bank Connection) involves handling sensitive financial data but lacks an explicit mention of data residency, which is a key requirement for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations."},
  {"id": "APBR-R-03", "type": "Governance Inconsistency", "severity": "High", "evidence": "BR-002 (AI Categorization) does not define behavior for low-confidence predictions. This could lead to high error rates if the system auto-categorizes everything, violating the 'autonomy with guardrails' principle."},
  {"id": "APBR-R-04", "type": "Missing Detail", "severity": "Medium", "evidence": "AP-002 (Duplicate Detection) describes flagging duplicates but the acceptance criteria is too simple, only checking for exact matches. The business value depends on fuzzy matching."},
  {"id": "APBR-R-05", "type": "Security Flaw", "severity": "High", "evidence": "A feature for executing payments (implied by AP-004) would be a high-value target but is not explicitly defined with necessary security controls like MFA triggers."}
]
Predicted_Failures: [
  {"scenario": "A high-volume customer complains that bills emailed at 9 AM are not available for processing until the afternoon, violating their operational cadence.", "probability": "High", "impact": "Medium", "trigger": "Customer onboarding and performance testing."},
  {"scenario": "A European customer is onboarded, and their banking data is inadvertently stored in a US-based data center, causing a major GDPR violation.", "probability": "High", "impact": "Critical", "trigger": "Onboarding of a non-US customer."},
  {"scenario": "The AI categorization agent, operating with a 70% confidence score, incorrectly categorizes thousands of transactions over a weekend, requiring a massive manual clean-up effort on Monday.", "probability": "Medium", "impact": "High", "trigger": "Processing a large batch of novel bank transactions."}
]
Fixes_Applied: [
  {"scope": "AP-001 NFRs", "change_summary": "Added a specific NFR: 'SLA for email ingestion: <2 minutes from receipt to draft bill creation.'"},
  {"scope": "AP-002 Acceptance Criteria", "change_summary": "Added a new Gherkin scenario for fuzzy matching, demonstrating detection based on vendor, similar amount, and close date."},
  {"scope": "AP-002 NFRs", "change_summary": "Added an NFR specifying that fuzzy matching parameters must be configurable per tenant."},
  {"scope": "BR-001 DB Schema & Security Notes", "change_summary": "Added 'data_residency_region' to the bank_connections table schema. Added an explicit security note: 'All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using region-specific keys to comply with data residency laws.'"},
  {"scope": "BR-002 Acceptance Criteria", "change_summary": "Added a new Gherkin scenario specifying that transactions with a confidence score below 95% must be flagged for manual review, not auto-categorized."},
  {"scope": "Feature Universe", "change_summary": "Renumbered subsequent features and added a new, dedicated feature 'AP-005: Schedule & Execute Bill Payments' to properly scope the high-risk action of executing payments, including a note about requiring MFA for large amounts."}
]
Validation_Proof: {
  "tests_passed": "Key NFRs (latency, data residency) are now explicit. AI governance guardrails (confidence thresholds) are defined. High-risk payment operations are scoped into a dedicated, secured feature.",
  "sims_passed": "Simulated EU compliance audit; data residency controls are now specified. Simulated AI operations review; low-confidence scenario is now handled safely.",
  "metrics_deltas": "N/A",
  "residual_risk": "Low. The feature specifications are more precise, secure, and compliant."
