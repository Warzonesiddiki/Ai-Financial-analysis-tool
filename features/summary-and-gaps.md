## Gap Analysis & Plan for Next Batches

This first batch establishes foundational capabilities in automating core AP/AR processes, enhancing reporting flexibility, and implementing enterprise-grade compliance and security.

The following domains have been identified as priorities for the next batches (Features 101-500+):

1.  **Procurement & Inventory Management**:
    *   **Gaps**: Currently no formal Purchase Order (PO) or Goods Receipt Note (GRN) system exists, which is a dependency for `AP-001`. Inventory management is basic.
    *   **Next Steps (Batch 2)**: Introduce full modules for Purchase Requisitions, POs, GRNs, Vendor RFQs, and advanced inventory features like multiple warehouses, stock transfers, and landed cost tracking.

2.  **Treasury & Cash Management**:
    *   **Gaps**: Cash flow forecasting is present but lacks advanced treasury functions. No multi-currency or hedging capabilities.
    *   **Next Steps (Batch 2/3)**: Introduce features for multi-currency accounting (FX gain/loss), bank account reconciliation automation, cash pooling, and financial instrument tracking.

3.  **Human Resources & Payroll (Global)**:
    *   **Gaps**: Payroll is basic and likely US-centric. It lacks features for global payroll, benefits administration, or detailed labor costing.
    *   **Next Steps (Batch 3)**: Design features for multi-jurisdiction payroll processing, leave management, benefits tracking, and timesheet integration for project costing.

4.  **Integrations & Developer Platform**:
    *   **Gaps**: While APIs are being specified, there is no formal developer platform, marketplace, or pre-built connectors for major ERPs (SAP, NetSuite), CRM (Salesforce), or HRIS (Workday) systems.
    *   **Next Steps (Batch 4)**: Specify a full suite of public APIs, a developer portal with documentation and sandboxes, an App Marketplace, and pre-built connectors.

5.  **AI Agents & Advanced Autonomy**:
    *   **Gaps**: While foundational AI agents are specified, more advanced autonomous capabilities are needed to fulfill the mission.
    *   **Next Steps (Batch 4/5)**: Design next-generation agents for autonomous month-end close, real-time compliance monitoring, predictive forecasting, and strategic recommendation generation.

Subsequent batches will systematically address these gaps, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all 40+ domains outlined in the project mission.
